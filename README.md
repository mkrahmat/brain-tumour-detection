# Brain Tumor Detection from X-ray Scans 🧠

This project uses deep learning to detect brain tumors from X-ray scan images. The model is trained using labeled image datasets and can classify whether an image contains signs of a tumor.

> ⚠️ Note: Several improvements, experiments, and evaluations can be done.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `code.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook for model training, evaluation, and predictions.
- `train/`: Contains labeled training X-ray scan images.
- `test/`: Contains labeled testing X-ray scan images.

Each of the `train/` and `test/` folders has subfolders like:
- gliomia_tumour
- meningioma_tumor
- pituitary_tumor
- no_tumor
